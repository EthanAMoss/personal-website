                    <p class="card-text">This website serves two main roles: a nice little personal page to get my name out there and a demonstration of some of the skills I've acquired. A good portion of my work experience has been making webapps much like this one, so it wouldn't be proper if I used some pre-made web template. Much like the many webapps I've already made, this uses a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>-powered backend of <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" class="card-link">Flask</a> and a frontend brought to life by <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> (along with the usual HTML and JavaScript).</p>

                    <p class="card-text">If you would like to see how this website ticks, why not check out the source code? I've hosted this and other projects on my GitHub account.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Right now, this is using the Bootstrap default theme, so it isn't too out there. Once I figure out the theme I'm using, there will be a link here. Also, the cool icons that my social links use are from <a href="https://www.fontawesome.com/" class="card-link">Font Awesome</a>.</p>
